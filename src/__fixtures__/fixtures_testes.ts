  Ao gerar as aventuras parece ser bom explicar as seguintes regras ao ChatGPT:
  The i representes the id of the 'scene'

Got it, so you would like to replace i with _id to represent the ID of the scene, correct?



The "i" representes the id of the 'scene', keep using the 'i',but remember its an ID.
The "g" representes a gold change, some scenes should increase or decrease the gold.
The "h" representes health change, some scenes should increase or decrease the gold.
The gold and health should change based on the scene text.
I want you to know that the "n" json representes a next scene.
So inside the "n" json we have a nsid that represents the id of a next scene.
"c" representes the choice in the current scene, that text will affect what happens in the next scene with the id in "nsid"
With this in mind, write me a small adventure with 5 prompts, connected with the next scene ids and with a tematic text.
The adventures should ahve no more that X ids, meaning if I tell you to write me an adventure with 7 scenes, there should
never be a next scene id of 8, nor should there be a scene with the id 8.
The scenes that represent the end of an adventure should have the "n" json empty. The keys of the json should not be
between "".
Here is an example with 6 scenes that have 3 endings, but you can have less than 3 as long as there is at least 1 ending.
