I want you to write me a simple story consisting of diferent scenes. Each scene should have 1 or more Choices, with the exception of the final scene, which should never have chices.
The story should have simple scenes, and should reference the reader in the first person, like 'you fall down'.
Each scene should be acompained by an ID, a number that starts at 1 and increments every scene.
Each scene needs a text for the story, and text for the possible choices. Acompaning the choices there should also be a next scene ID so that we can navigate the story, choosing our own 'path'.
